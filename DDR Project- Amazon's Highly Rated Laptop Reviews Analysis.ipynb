The setting up process was very simple, it didnt come charge so you will need to charge it. The keyboard is sleek and like how theres a number pad. It does get in the way of my typing but thats okay. It does have the type c adapter thing which is basically the same as the newer iPhone needing an adapter to use wired headphones. It does have 1tb of storage which I didnt believe that could be real for this price same as 16gbs of ram. It has a Bluetooth adapter as advertised and its fairly simple to connect to any headphones or earbuds. It does run very fast because of the 16GBs. If you were to get the 8gb or anything lower it will run on the slower end. It isnt touch screen which I personally like because I dont have to worry about cleaning my screen often. The camera is great for the price. I wouldnt use my laptops speakers because it wont sound as good as using earbuds or headphones. I havent tested the mic yet. The battery life I havent tested however when I start college I will make sure I update how far it runs. I would definitely recommend anyone who is going into college to buy this laptop. The storage and ram at this price is amazing.'},\n",

I had no idea that this brand new computer at least for me with Windows 11 wouldn't be able to do half of what my old one did, yet cost approximately 250 more.  It's not a gaming PC, but it can't even keep up with a game that's 11 years old.  The screen resolution maxes out at 1366x768.  Yes, you read that correctly.  I feel like I paid almost 700 for a computer that would've been fantastic 15 years ago, yet it's a 2021 model.  What a ripoff.\"},\n",

Yes, there HP security, but it is minimal. It does have Widows 11. I have not found it to be that much different for Windows 10. Yes, icon is in different locations with a different look. But still work the same. It's does come with Office 365 with a 30day trial. After that you need to pay a subscription. I suggest you download Libre Office. Works the same way and I found no issues with Libre so far. The battery life last for hours and recharge quickly. It is NOT touchscreen, just add a mouse or better yet, a wireless mouse. Works just fine The laptop weighs 3.64 lbs. so light to take just about anywhere, like an airplane and I have. I feel it is a lot of laptop for the price. 32GB Ram and 1TB is a big Plus\"},\n",

But is it any goodWell, to be clear I think the efforts made by Acer deserve a bit of credit.  From the packaging to the laptop itself it's obvious Acer is making a big deal of it all.  Most every feature in this laptop is tied back to the environment in some way, whether it's the casing great to the software features good and the upgradelength of service path fair.  I'll start with the basics and go into more detail as warranted.The computer model here is a 11th generation Intel i7 with 16 GB of RAM, 512 GB SSD, and onboard graphics.  The reality is that the computer itself is, in my opinion, a pretty solid middle tier everyday laptop.  It's going to do very well with routine things, whether light duty as an email machine to heavier things like Microsoft Office including Teams meetings.  Nothing in any of those use cases stressed this computer out at all.  Even some gaming worked well, though because of the lower class of the CPU there are i7 CPUs with more cores and thus more threads in laptops at this price point, though power consumption would be an issue here...more on that in a minute and lack of discrete graphics meant most modern 3D games were out of reach unless they were run on very low settings.  But it's not a gaming laptop...it's a productivity machine meant for home use, and it's being sold that way.However, some of the design choices make clear that compromises were made.  Take the screen, probably the most obvious compromise.  It's...not stellar.  The brightness is not there, and the colors look to be washed out.  Again, not the worst sin for a word processorspreadsheet machine, but get into graphics or photos and the deficiencies become clear.  Viewing angles are fine, but when looked at next to other laptops in this price range the differences are rather stark.Another issue is the battery.  The first thing I did when receiving this unit is take the cover off and look inside.  The battery is a 54 WH unit, but the case sure seems to have a lot of wasted space.  Since I'm of the school that the value proposition of a laptop is portability, not having more battery fill the space seems curious to me.  True, I got around five to five and a half hours out of the battery in regular use performance mode, but it could be better.  And I can't blame the CPU either  it's not the fastest chip in the i7 stable, so power consumption there isn't the problem.Also looking at the innards, I see that the speakers face downward.  Again, not the worst sin for a productivity laptop, and while the sound quality was decent for the size of the speakers meaning enough for video calls this isn't going to reproduce music enough to catch the subtleties in the piece.Then there's the expandability.  Kudos to Acer for using standard screws, slight ding for using a lot of them eleven, to be precise.  There is only one SODIMM slot, and 8 of the shipped 16 GB is soldered to the motherboard. Further, my research suggests that the memory slot can only handle up to eight GB, so at 16 GB the RAM is pretty well maxed out.  The SSD is a different story, using a PCIe card that can, certainly, be easily swapped out for a larger capacity if needed.  However, do you need it  512GB isn't horrible for this laptop given the constraints of the other hardware again, you aren't going to be playing RDR2 here so while it CAN be expanded there, odds are it won't NEED to be.  And given the CPU constraints, there's likely very little need to expand the specs beyond the 16GB RAM anyway....The touchpad is...fine.  The fingerprint sensor is in the upper left corner, and while I appreciate that it has one, sometimes it does get in the way.  There's no glass surface on the touchpad, so longer sessions can be a bit of an annoyance what with the texture and all.  In addition, the touchpad frame has a bit of give to it, so clicking as opposed to finger tapping can be another bit of an annoyance.The case itself is probably my favorite part of the laptop.  It's a neat anchor gray with texture and interesting flecks of color.  I particularly appreciate not having fifteen stickers on the laptop telling me what processor it has and such.  This said, there is a bit of flex in the middle of the keyboard...pushing down in the middle of the home row makes this obvious.  But, the case is grippy and looks much different than pretty much anything out there.Speaking of the keyboard, it's rather decent.  Not the best keyboard I've ever used but a nice one nonetheless.  The E and R keys are reversed which is an interesting design choice, and is intended to draw attention to the environmental spirit in which this laptop was made.  Backlighting is a bit odd, as it can only be on or off no brightness levels are available.It shipped with Windows 11, something I really appreciated.  Bloatware is at a minimum, though I did spend about an hour cleaning it out and installing Windows updates.As for performance, as I said it does a very good job as an everyday laptop.  It's not something you'd use for video editing, not something that you'd use for first tier gaming, but as a regular old laptop it does a very good job.  Honestly, this configuration 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD is about as much as I'd want to have available for this machine.  It handles routine tasks with grace.But is it any good  As I type this I wonder why Acer didn't include an insightful summary key.Frankly, while I appreciate the laptop very much on its own terms, I have to look at it in comparison to other laptops at this price point.  The most glaring differences are the screen and battery.  Competitor laptops also boast recycled materials in the production, but I think they fail a bit when it comes to the styling.  So while this laptop does come up a bit short when it comes to a few items, there's a certain je ne sais quoi here that makes it a good laptop for the home or for educational use.  For instance, the camera isn't going to be a super high res video machine, but for Microsoft Teams it's wholly appropriate.And perhaps that's the takeaway here.  The computer is...appropriate for what it's intended to do.  It's drawing attention to the many tons of plastic waste that can be reused to make things like this.  It's not an over the top machine, but rather something that sits almost perfectly in a place for every day use that, thanks to running Windows 11, will keep it in service for quite some time.  So in that vein, I find that while from a pure technical perspective it may be wanting in a few areas, in all honesty I find I don't mind all that much.  I'll keep my Acer Predator for the pure gaming...but when I'm needing to write out things for work or do other adulting....this will be the machine I use.\"},\n",

       "  'Text Review': \"Update Opened it up, today 322023. Found out that it is pretty simple inside. A Kingston NVME which is good, though no dram cache, and I also found a very very beefy cooler though there is a caveat. Normally, a cooler contacts the onboard iGPU as well as the cpu, but there was no contact with the iGPU and the plate was cut to avoid it. I think the design, which has solder points for a embedded graphics card, with two ram chip spots, a gpu socket, and power delivery traces on the board, was meant to be routed over the embedded gpu. That would mean that the iGPU didn't need to be cooled. I was able to fix the lack of contact with a heat pad, I think a 0.5 thickness pad. It was not a high thermal transfer style, but anything thicker than 0.5 would cause a lack of contact with the CPU and thermal control would become a issue. The beefy cooler offers a dual fan setup, which is well made, and a lengthy fin array to dissipate heat delivered from two wide heat pipes that seem routed to perfectly go over where a embedded GPU would be. The whole thing is quite a stretch, but can easily keep the CPU cool, and that now include the iGPU which doesn't seem to be monitored by the motherboard.First off, I love the case on this. It is a robust plastic case, with a bit of flare. It attempts to look more recycled than it actually is, and seems to be a cast casing. It is super durable and it really is made with recycled materials just colors added to pellets and formed to look this special way. I had no issues with the durability of this computer. Even comes with a case. Moreover, it has a very pleasing texture that is surprisingly smooth butThere are issues though. I think this is the first modern 1080p screen I could see the pixels clearly on. They are aligned in rows and columns that are nearly straight and it gives way to a image that looks very grainy. This effect was not as bad on Acer's Swift X but that one is no rose either, but another addition to awesome case design. Despite the graininess the colors appear to be accurate and brightness is great here.Moving on from display, the next issue was performance, and this is where I stopped. Even after removing the antivirus, the performance this should have was substantially lower than it should be. Comparing it the the previous gen I7 in my Dell XPS, and I know that is a XPS but the processor was in the same category. The Dell XPS I own has a Core i71065G7 while this is a i71195G7. Where did the performance go and why am I unable to recover it The CPU is not horrible and I hope that is understandable, but it is limited to its' full performance and when looking at synthetic workloads it is noticeable. I think I read something about how the 11th gen was actually worse in performance to 10th gen but this was more than expected. This had a CPU score of 4470, where the average seems to be over 5000 for the same part. No matter how many times, five times for testing, I kept getting the same numbers  70. In real life interactions, I couldn't notice the difference when using it though it was notably slower in loading some programs compared to both the Swift X and the Dell XPS 9300. Loading items is often related to the performance of the SSDHDD and not the processor, especially one this fast.Software on this was surprisingly minimal and I love that. There was limited bloatware, but some of the bloatware included Firefox, which I don't hate but use a different web browser at home. Opera There is some maintenance software, which is on the simple side, but in the bad direction where things aren't really clearly setup and you have to familiarize yourself with the layout. I don't hate it, but it is not as good as the Dell software that accomplishes the same thing. The Dell software is more dummy proof. I personally recommend getting a different antivirus. I can't say Norton is bad, but this is more than you probably need and it really does impact performance a lot. I use Bitdefender personally, but Norton also has their Internet Security suite which is good. There are also companies like Kaspersky, Webroot, Trend Micro, Avira, and Avast to consider and I do recommend any of these as they are all good just something less resource intensive than what comes on these Acers.Now, it does actually come with everything most people need, unless you like 3D gaming or making games. Performance limitation aside it does exactly what I would expect for my wife, who this is intended for. It allows for a virtual environment which she needs for her work, it allows her to do video calls for her meetings, and it is larger than my dell XPS screen making it easier to sit further back. A surprising plus is that it comes with 512 gb NVMe ssd and 16gb DDR4 memory. I did not open it up to check if it is replaceable memory, but I am thinking it is not replaceable as that seems to be the trend these days. Getting inside the computer is easy enough, but I did stop taking notes around the performance testing. I was initially really upset, but I also have to remember, my wife isn't using this as a power user. Battery life seems decent enough but I never fully drained it to test total hours. I am not a fan of the power supply and wish you could use a USB C style charger like the Acer Swift X and Dell XPS can do. It has the port, just not the ability.Here's my dilemma though. I don't hate this laptop enough to give it a 3, but everything I saw fault with doesn't allow me to give it a 4. And that's the thing, even with its' issues I don't hate it I kind of like it still. Not enough to replace my Dell XPS 9300, but still enough to pull it up and watch a video or browse the internet. The graininess in the display seems to be transient and I forget it is there after some time, but I know its' still there once I walk away too. The colors are good on the display though. I would expect that at this price I would get a touch screen, but it is missing that. Side note Windows 11 is much like Windows 8, where it seems directed at touch screen displays. Missing that and it makes navigating on the not bad touch pad more difficult but that is not Acer's fault. I can still recommend this, just understand the faults before buying it.\"},\n",

The last update i worked with was 10 and had an good amount of experience with microsoft 8. 11 by far the worse one ever. too complex and too much setting up, i spent 2 DAYS setting up my computer to be able to just use it. im not even old wth is wrong with microsoft the process had me stressing.Second when i was trying to change settings i noticed i couldnt change the timezone to mine even if i was the administrator it wouldnt let me i made another account, made it another admin and still couldnt change a damn thing, which leads me to believe they dont hand the laptop over completely unlocked what kind of software do you guys have on this preinstalled also it took me a couple weeks but i found out the screen was warped and the front panel was bulged off the screen slightly thats actual trash quality should have expected that for 600Now the Real problem up until a week ago i was playing Roblox ifk when it just blue screened, mid game. not even that demanding of a game. then the error messages said that a file or one of its dependencies couldnt be verified. or something like it. then it went back to working for a day and then it said The operating system couldn't be loaded because the kernel is missing or contains errors. the computer now just wont boot up to the lock screen after a week of working an not working. it said i need recovery tools but i dont have any and im guessing ill just have to send it back. and you want to promote a more greener computer love the message but please take this into consideration.\"},\n",

The slight drawbacks are, the battery life. It doesn't last nearly as long as I would like it to when unplugged. Secondly the screen resolution, while not bad, is not as good as the portable monitors that I own that are of the same resolution and type. Lastly, one of the major exhaust vents is located just below the monitor on top of the keyboard. When it's on, you, and everyone around you can hear it. Quite honestly, it's annoying, but it's not a deal breaker for me. Overall, this laptop is definitely a good buy for the money. I don't really care about all the environmentally friendly stuff.

The video is not as sharp or fast as one would expect, in fact there is too much glare and is very sluggish as if it is an LCD display from the 1990s. Definitely a low budget machine where the manufacturer cut lots of corners and I will be reminded of that every time I turn it on. Don't bother to remove the base to upgrade as the demo video mostly falsely advertises, I already did that pointless effort and provided a picture. As one reviewer pointed out, what is up with the R and the E keys being printed backwards I also had to  spend some time removing bloatware, trialware, and crapware. I will grudgingly keep this machine until I find a more proven desirable one.\"},\n",

Supposedly it may have been because it had an older version of Norton and required a Norton cleanup tool to remove it. Also, it said I did not have access to uninstall it.  In other words, it came without giving full access to the user. I checked my access and i had full access as i was the only user and owner, but when I tried to delete the software it kept saying it was running somewhere else and I had to close there first. That message was not true. It was a pain from the moment i started it. The popups were terrible, especially the NORTON window pop up and I could not close the Norton popup unless I restarted the program I was using. In addition, The 'R' and 'E' keys are highlighted in yellow and are backward on the keyboard see image. The reason is the 'R' and 'E' keys are highlighted in yellow and are written backward to reflect the principles of review, rethink, recycle, and reduce. What a stupid ID for the user.

I think the environmental stuff is a little farfetched considering the impact made by making these, their batteries, etc. but I digress. The weird backwards R and E keys threw me at first but it's another little hip nod to the environmental focus for this machine.The case is a sturdy rigid plastic that almost feels like something you'd expect the military to use. I wouldn't say it's tacticalgrade plastic, but it doesn't feel flimsy.Actual performance is not bad at all at this price point. You get a great SSD drive which also helps speed. Battery life is not what I had hoped for, around 3ish hours before it asks to be plugged in. I am a bit of a power user so that would explain that. It does get warm and the fan is a little on the noisy side. This is something that is remedied with a quality fan base underneath it if you'll be using for a while.Very nice display on the screen.  I really really don't like the battery packs that Acer makes for these, it is a proprietary weird little plug. It came with a sturdy nylon bag.\"},\n",

       "  'Text Review': \"This is a longterm review after about six months of use where I have taken it to a couple of different countries, and a few more layovers with long waiting times, where it was a very welcomed companion.First, I took it to Vietnam, where I was traveling around the countryside as a part of a charity organization to teach English to impoverished andor orphaned kids. We just teach the basics, mainly the alphabets, numbers, and easy essential phrases, as well as proper pronunciation. The main purpose and goal is to bring smiles to the children's faces, as it might be, and effectively is, the only time we will see them until the next time we do another event, and even then it's most likely to a different part or different space of the country. Rarely, we can host it in a space that has some equipment, such as a TV, and Internet connection. But in most cases, it's a simple classroom, or just a room, without anything, and that's where this laptop has come through for us.First. it is not one of those chic svelte mini laptops, and for the better, as you'd want something with a bit more ruggedness or empty space to absorb nicks and bumps. Second, it comes with everything I need for an endeavor like this Strong CPU, lots of RAM to have multiple programs open without making multitasking sluggish, and lots of storage space in a fast, SSD form. And finally, a big screen with enough brightness to use in a brightlylit room. I get all this for less than 1000, and as of this review, it's now only 700, making it an easy recommendation.It's very versatile in that I used it to play songs to the kids, play YouTube videos and their downloads when there wasn't an Internet connections, and with a cheap external USB DVD attachment, also movies. We also had USB drives with movies stored in case. I was also able to show the kids some PowerPoint and Google Slides presentations. All in all, this is a fullfledged modern laptop that can pretty much do everything other laptop that cost more than 1500 can do. I think the main compromise came with the screen it wasn't 4K or OLED or any of those fancy technologies, but for what I needed it for, I didn't have the need for a highend screen. It's bright enough, and big enough to satisfy a room of 2040 kids.I also took it to Thailand, with stopovers in Korean and Japan, and it serviced great. I fit into my travel backpack without any issues. In short, enjoy this wonderful laptop while saving some money.\"},\n",

I got this computer in July not even two months old this happened and the original purchase was injan. There are others that the same thing happened to. Just make sure you have a warranty and when it starts getting hard to open up take it in right away. Other than that I love the computer. The audio isn't too loud.abd I never tried out the wifi. Didn't even know it and with that. Just hope they don't screw me.\"},\n",

       "  'Text Review': \"This is a high performing budget laptop. For what it is, it's great. It has more than enough ram, a solid processor, and lightning fast wifi. But if you want this laptop to be much more than just a powerful barebones laptop, you might be disappointed. This Aspire Vero is my first new computer in 5 years since I got my Surface Laptop 1, and in some ways, the Vero is actually a downgrade.  I'm going to emphasize areas I have issues with first, because I think that starting with the cons is more useful than the pros.Areas that need improvement1 The speakers are dissapointing. Pretty low volume. Downward facing speakers, so there is really poor projection, and the audio is muffled unless it's on a hard surface. Overall it's just very subpar audio quality from the Vero, and a big downgrade for me.2 Low screen brightness. Some people say 250 nits doesn't matter, but it does. Using it in direct sunlight is a big issue. My Surface Laptop 1 is 378 nits and I can tell a huge difference in brightness.3 The clickpad is really hard to press. I would say it takes probably twice as much effort to click as my Surface laptop, and just doesn't feel very ergonomically designed. The trackpad itself is very large and perfectly fine, but the clickpad  not so much.4 A minor issue, but the backlit keys only have 1 level of brightness. I like typing late at night, and don't need max brightness for that. A bigger issue with the backlit keys, is that if you look at the keyboard from any kind of a downwards angle, the LEDs are visible and kind of glaring. It's just a little detail that was overlooked, but it bothers me because I notice it EVERY time I use the laptop on my bed or laying down.5 The battery life could be better. I get 5 hours if I'm lucky.The Good1 Super fast wifi. I get nearly 400mbps on the Vero vs 150mbps on my Surface laptop.  It's a huge upgrade for me in regards to internet speed.2 The IPS display and colors on the Vero are actually excellent. They seem just as good as good as my 2k Surface laptop. The only display issue is with the brightness  and the fact that the screen has a matte finish rather than glassglossy.3 Plenty of ram and memory. Solid processor. Unless you're doing some serious gaming or video editing, this should work quite smoothly. The 16gb ram really future proofs this device for a few years, and can easily handle the 1000 tabs I have tend to have open.4 Environmentally conscious, unique design, and feels very nice in the hand. The material is a grippy, textured plastic almost like rubber. I quite like it, but the laptop definitely doesn't look as sleek as some others.5 Doesn't get hot, and has very quiet fans that only rarely run.ThoughtsIn a lot of ways, I really like the Vero. It has great specs, plenty of ram, and incredibly fast internet speeds. Based on the specs alone, it is excellent and future proof for some years even without factoring in the upgradability. But that begs the question, why make an upgradable laptop with less than amazing display, speakers, and aesthetics Overall, I recommend this laptop highly to anyone that needs a high performance budget laptop. It won't give you a premium experience, but it performs excellently and has more than enough power for most people. But if you are like me  and value display, audio quality, and overall feel  well, maybe an older generation flagship laptop would be better for you.\"},\n",

       "  'Text Review': \"What impressed me the most Acer was one of the few to use an i71195G7 in a laptop within this price range and it remains cool  quiet.  For work laptops I always avoided i7s due to the extra heatfan noise, this is one area Acer pulled off with their very good cooling engineering. This is a nice balanced laptop which will fit the needs of a student  office work.  The included travel sleeve provides basic protection.The screen is a nice crisp 1080p IPS display, brightness is plenty for indoors but if you're sitting at a window or outdoors it'll be hard to see the screen and this is true with most laptops unless you specifically buy a laptop with a brighter screen.Keyboard has some flex while typing compared to past laptops I've ownedused, the backwards letters of R  E aren't noticeable if you type without looking at the keyboard and the keyboard backlight is either on or off without any brightness control.  The squished or shrunken number pad is still a plus for those of us who still need one on a laptop.Trackpad is nice and large with reasonable amount of pressure to click left or right. The builtin fingerprint reader on the top left of the trackpad is in a reasonable location if you do plan to use fingerprint login.Processor is a fast i71195G7, a quadcore with a turbo of up to 5Ghz is nice to have if you're crunching data on your laptop or needing to run some desktop software on the go.  If you're looking for desktop replacement level tasks you're really better off with a gaming laptop such as an Acer Nitro with a dedicated GPU which isn't that much more.Memory  Storage. For most owners 16GB of memory  512GB SSD should be plenty, the ability to open the laptop to upgrade memory or the SSD is a nice plus with the Vero.The ports are two USB 3.0, one USB 2.0, one USBC port, HDMI and Ethernet which should be plenty for many users.Speakers are above average in my option, you get a reasonable amount of mids and lows without sounding too muddy, bassy or tinny.Builtin Webcam is 720p, I found it to be a bit grainy but again I use a Logitech webcam.Battery life in my usage was closer to under 5.5 hours, as with any laptop your battery life will vary on usage.Build quality this laptop does have case flex at the keyboard and around the trackpad but for the most part feels on par with most modern thinner laptops. Weight wise its average for a 15 laptop.  For work I've used business grade 14 laptops that sometimes weighed as much as a consumer 15 laptop so size doesn't always mean much.ConclusionThis is a well rounded laptop for a wide range of usage and there are plenty of reasons to recommend this laptop. If you're like me where upgrading a laptop with more memory or a larger SSD to extend the usage life, the Vero is worth considering. Every laptop has their pros  cons, you'll often have to choose what matters the most to your requirements.\"},\n",

The R and E keys are a different color and are mirrored to be backward to play on the reduce, reuse, recycle theme.THE LAPTOPThe value and specs are pretty good, it's snappy and runs well. The fingerprint reader was a nice touch except that with two users it's become unreliable and that's incredibly annoying. Seems like a software issue but I'm not sure but will do more troubleshooting on it.The screen does look pretty great and 16 gb of ram helps it be responsive. Overall it's a nice machine for the price point and I like the postconsumer materials thing I just hope it's not a case of pure greenwashing.\"},\n",

       "  'Text Review': \"Last year I bought two small form factor SFF computes, an Intel NUC and a MinisForum Ryzen 9 equipped SFF computer. By the time I added RAM, operating system and hard drives, they were both past 1200. Why SFF computers Because I have two nice monitors that I like to mount NUCs to via their VESA mounts on the back.I think I was out of my mind to put that money into SFF computers when you can get as good performance from this midrange Acer, plus a 512 GB hard drive and 16 GB of RAM. The only advantage of the SFF computers is that they mount on the back of my 27inch monitors. Yet this Acer comes with an OK monitor, and you can use it with video out either of its two USB 3.2 ports to drive a 4K 27inch monitor at twothirds the price of a NUC.Lets note a few things before listing positives and a few negatives. This is a green computer from Acer, which means its case is made not from regular plastic or aluminum, but from a recycled plastic material. Logos and branding are not painted on the case, but engraved into the plastic. The processor is one generation back from the latest Intel generation 12 Core processors but you won't find the processor lacking. It's an i7, and it benchmarks respectably close to more expensive laptops. It has Intel's integrated Xe graphics, a major step up from past Intel integrated graphics.OK, positives include1 Good variety of ports including two fast USBA 3.2 ports, a 3.2 USBC port, a USBA 2.0 port, ethernet and HDMI 2.2 OK 15inch screen matte finish with 1920x1080 resolution. Nothing special, just a good basic screen.3 Tactile backlit keyboard feels fairly precise, not mushy.4 Goodsized trackpad with builtin Windows Hello fingerprint scanner5 Fast processor6 Body opens easily via Philips screwdriver for upgrading parts.7 Good speakersNegative1 Body has a fair bit of flex.2 7.5 hour battery life is on the short endand probably unachievable in typical office use.3 Display isn't the brightest and keyboard backlighting is not adjustable.In summary, this is a competent laptop. At the price it's being sold for it's a relative bargain. You can spend three times as much and not gain a whole lot more for your money in pure usability. Gaming and graphicsintensive work may want something more powerful, but I'm not a gamer and I've run Photoshop and Premiere on much less powerful computers and gotten things done, if a bit slowly, in years past. I strongly commend this machine to those looking for a good, basic laptop.\"},\n",

       "  'Text Review': \"SO this has an IPS monitor which gives you higher definition and clarity than an LED monitor. But also it uses more energy and these types of monitors are known for heating up and overheating which can cause premature failure. To further add to this issue, some genius put its heat fan pointed RIGHT at the front of the monitor. I've never seen this in a laptop and don't understand why they couldn't vent it out the side or even reposition the monitor slightly so they could vent the heat out the back. I'm really hoping that the heat blowing onto the monitor that's already known for heat issues isn't gonna be an issue. Within a few short minutes of regular browsing, its fan is blowing nonstop and the bottom part of the actual computer screen is getting hot because of the exhaust fan.Other than the screen and heat issue, the laptop seems to be nicely made. It only took a couple of minutes to setup and streams videos surfs the net flawlessly when paired with my gigabit internet. It's not slow at all loads programs quickly and loads web pages quickly.I think it's a good computer overall and they're on the right track with this one. It looks really cool and runs great The thing that I love about it's finish is it's not glossy those always scratch up and look junky quickly. The finish on this one will stay looking great for years I'm sure\"},\n",

       "  'Text Review': \"I got this for my 12 year old daughter so she's not constantly using her school issued Chromebook. This Windows system offers more options but it's still super easy for her to use. I was very impressed with the speed of this laptop. An i7 processor is awesome and should really be the standard at this point. After a few initial windows updates it was ready for use. Wifi setup was a breeze, and I didn't run into any issues otherwise. We tested various sites as well as NetflixAmazon Video. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the visuals. My daughter just wanted to see how well Minecraft worked and I am happy to report it's pretty flawless. For this price range, this is a great starter mid laptop for simple, everyday uses. And the design was also a plus for my daughter, she really loves the flecks all over, and it stands out from other laptops. Overall I'm really impressed and we'll see how long it will last without issues, or before it slows down, as electronics inevitably do. Battery life is fair, comparable to most other laptops. Like I said, for a middle school kid, it's a great choice\"},\n",

       "  'Text Review': \"This has worked out to be great productivity laptop for me. It performs pretty much as one would expect it to with the specs it has. It of course isn't a hardcore gaming machine, but it can play some games with reasonable settings. It's not loaded with bloatware other than what Microsoft has started including in windows. It does have some Acer specific update software, but I feel it is reasonable.Given it's price, it is a solid deal. It has a very nice screen, a great amount of ram and respectable storage. Many systems even at this price would come with less ram or a cheaper, slower, or smaller ssd drive. It is easy to open up and replace the storage or ram if needed. And researching it more, I've found many of the other internal parts are easy to replace as well so easy to get repaired if ever necessary.The only thing that took some getting used to was the unique look of the chassis. But knowing that it's recycled material and that even it's internals are made in a way that does promote ewaste makes getting used to it worth it.One thing I do wish the did differently is the inclusion of a full size numpad. I feel like it makes the keyboard feel as though it is shifted too far left for normal typing It took me quite some time to get used it to, but it's definitely the kind of thing that is pretty subjective.Overall this is a good budget laptop that is well specced and well priced with the bonus of being eco friendly. The fact that it comes with a decent laptop sleeve is pretty nice too.\"},\n",

       "  'Text Review': \"I was really surprised to see a laptop with these specs for only 750.  This new Acer Aspire Vero is made from PCR plastics.  PCR stands for postconsumer recycled.  So if you buy this laptop you're not only getting yourself a great computer, but you're doing something good for the environment as well.  The outer surface of the laptop is textured, so you don't have to worry about it sliding off your desk.  It also feels good when I'm typing and my palms are resting against the computer.  Speaking of keyboard, it has one of the nicest keyboards I have ever used on a laptop.  I can type just as fast as I do on my primary desktop computer.  The processor in this laptop is a 4core Intel i71195G7, which is pretty fast.  The singlecore Geekbench 5 score is 1,444 and the multicore score is 4,776.  Plus you get 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD drive.  The sleeve that comes with the laptop is even nicer than the one that Acer included with my gaming laptop.  The only disadvantage that I see to this model is the weight.  It weighs 7.48 pounds, so it's not a machine that you want to take everywhere you go, but it would make a perfect desktop replacement.\"},\n",

At only 500 gigs in storage for all the programs and files, it would normally never be enough for all programs and files.  However, as with many people, I've started to store my files on USB sticks with backups either online or to a redundant USB stick.  Compared to other computer tablets, it has a great deal of RAM, plenty of USB ports, and runs my poker and backgammon games.  For me, no poker and no backgammon means I don't want the computer  worse if it says it will work, and then it doesn't.  This computer does exactly what it says it will do and that has made me very happy.  If you need a mediumpowered computer and have only a limited budget  this will work for you.\"},\n",

While there are many great tool bags, the Fluke bag provided the desired pockets for my test equipment.  However, it limits your laptop to no more than 12 inches in width.  Since I did not want to struggle pulling it out, I looked for something in the 11 inch width range.I found this laptop on Amazon and it meet what I like for field service work.  It has a decent processor, memory and sizeable solid state drive.  Plus it is also a 21 laptop so that it functions as a tablet with touch screen.  To top it off, I felt the price was very good and a brand that I felt comfortable with.I ordered the laptop in the afternoon with a next day shipping promise.  It got here the next morning at 530 am.  IMPRESSIVE work AmazonThe seller professionally doublepacked my new laptop and it powered up flawlessly.  I am very impressed with the performance and quality of this laptop.Just a note  I only plan on using this for work and typically only use Office.
